data is in a markdown file named [categoryId]/[setting_id].md

where [categoryId] is the name of the folder the category is in
where [setting_id] is the id of the setting given in the code, you can either find this by looking at the code and finding the id inside that, or by opening the soopyaddonsbetafeaturesdata.json file inside soopyAddonsData and finding the id there

index.js has functionality to host the files on my server and will be run from that

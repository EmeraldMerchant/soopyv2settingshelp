This works by making everyone in the party that has the map enabled send the locations of everyone else within their render distance to everyone in the party

This has the effect of fixing incorrect locations around other people using the category on the map

In theory if everyone in the party is using soopyv2 and has this category enabled the map will always be 100% accurate with player locations.

You do not have to enable "Render Map" to have this syncing occur, it will happen as long as the category is enabled.
(The syncing will not show up on any other map types, it will only be visable on soopyv2 dungeon map)

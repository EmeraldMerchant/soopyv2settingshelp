This option is only for supporting enderman slayer t4 rcm : Daedalus Axe swap.
This option only works well when you are using a Hyp and Fire Veil Wand combined.
If you do not use a Fire Veil Wand, DO NOT enable this option!

This option also only supports Hyp users with Thunderlord 6/7 on it,
if you are using thunderbolt, or thunderlord 5 and less, this won't work properly!

It will add a text next to your soopyv2 costum eman hp overlay, that tells you how many
more times you have to right click your Hyp before swapping to hold Dae Axe.

For the second option "Hyp single click damage", please enter your normal Hyp single hit
damage thats not buffed by thunderlord enchant.
To test that, you can place down an enderman training dummy on your island.
Every 3rd hits the damage would be singificantly increased, and that's the thunderlord damage.
You want to input the 1st or 2nd lower damage number, and not the 3rd higher damage number.

!Important! Please round up your input damage number to the nearest million integer.
example: if your damage is 3,320,109.0, round it up to 3M, and enter 3 in the box
if your damage is 3,618,782.0, round it up to 4M
